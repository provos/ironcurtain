## Guiding Principles

1. **Least privilege**: The agent may only access resources explicitly permitted by policy.
2. **No destruction**: Delete operations outside the sandbox are never permitted, unless an explicit exception is granted by the user guidance.
3. **Human oversight**: Operations outside the sandbox require explicit human approval.
